Vocational Trainee Intern, National Aluminium Company – Angul, India 	     	                                            June - July 2018

Scrutinized historical data from various equipment sensors like level sensors, pressure switches, etc. to identify potential equipment failures using Tableau and MS Excel

Performed root cause and trend analysis on  historical data to look for patterns and correlations between unusual readings, deviations from normal operating conditions with downtimes

Visualized the findings and presented the findings to senior management resulting in an increase of productivity by 2.6% and a reduction of 1.8% in downtimes

### Projects
AMTRAK Ridership Forecasting (R programming)				

Worked on a data set comprising 270 data points containing monthly ridership data from January 1991 to May 2013

Visualized the data set to identify the trend and significance of Autocorrelation Coefficients

Based on Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Percentage Error, Automated Holt Winter’s model was found to be a better prediction when compared with Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average and Regression-based models

Zillow Housing Data Project (Python, Jupyter Notebook)				             

Deployed the BeautifulSoup Python Library to extract desired data from Zillow URL in an automated way followed by Data Cleaning, Outlier Detection, and exploratory analysis to formulate models based on Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting.

Compared with the official Zestimate, the gradient boosting model was found to be a close fit with an accuracy of 80.63%.

Walmart E-Commerce Database Clone (MySQL)					  

Designed a DBMS model on a fictional E-Commerce company using MySQL to store, manipulate, and inquire into the database. Devised Entity Relationship model identifying all entities, attributes, and relationships and built database schema.

Analysis and Prediction of Marketing Campaign Effectiveness(R programming)

Worked on a data set comprising 768587 data points.


Explored, cleaned, and preprocessed data using Pivot table, Bar Chart, and Heat Map

The Classification Tree model was the best model with an accuracy of 89.48% after comparing it to KNN, Linear Regression Models

Predicting Crime Types in Los Angeles using Machine Learning Algorithms(Jupyter Notebook)

This dataset was directly sourced from official LAPD database (https://data.lacity.org/Public-
Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8) comprising of 739687 rows and 28 columns, providing detailed attributes such as the date of occurrence, time of occurrence, area of occurrence, premise where the crime took place, crime type, latitude, longitude, the district where it was reported, and victim details including age, sex, and descent.

Three different classifications were implemented: multiclass prediction, bi-class prediction (violent and non-violent crimes), and specific crime types within violent crimes.

In the multiclass prediction classification CatBoost Classifier had highest accuracy of 35.8% while in binomial classification the CatBoost Classifier had highest accuracy of 70.37% and in case of violent only crimes the Random Forest Classifier had highest accuracy of 59.55%
